# CLAUDE.md — text-align developer notes

## Project purpose

CLI toolchain for creating and refining word-level alignments between Bible translations
and their source texts (Greek NT / Hebrew OT). Alignment format is Scripture Burrito 0.4
with project-specific `meta` extensions (primary/secondary, NEQ, idiom).

## Key conventions

- **Alignment direction:** always translation → source. Records ask "what Greek/Hebrew
  word(s) are behind this translation word?"
- **Primary vs secondary:** primary = direct lexical/semantic connection; secondary =
  grammatically implied with no separate source token.
- **NEQ:** a positive claim of non-equivalence — never use as a fallback for uncertainty.
- See `docs/alignment-principles-nt.md` (NT/Greek) and `docs/alignment-principles-ot.md` (OT/Hebrew) for the full specification.

## Multi-language prompt system (`refine/prompt/`)

Prompts are assembled from a `LanguagePromptConfig` registered per ISO 639-3 code.
The directory has two testament subdirectories (`nt/`, `ot/`) plus shared infrastructure:

- `common.py` — `LanguagePromptConfig` dataclass, shared prompt assembly and verse
  formatting functions (including `_format_source_token`). No registry lives here.
- `nt/core.py` — NT registry (`register_language` / `get_language_config`), Greek NT
  phenomenon detection (`detect_phenomena`), and NT-specific prompt assembly.
- `ot/core.py` — OT registry and `detect_phenomena` for Hebrew OT phenomena.
- `nt/eng.py` — English block strings + `ENG_CONFIG`; calls `register_language` on import.
- `nt/por.py` — Portuguese. Pro-drop, contracted preposition+article forms (do/da/no/na/
  ao/à/pelo/pela), conditional proper-name articles (BP retains them), reflexive passive,
  personal infinitive. Unchanged blocks imported from `eng.py`.
- `nt/spa.py` — Latin American Spanish. Same pro-drop rules; contracted forms limited to
  `del` and `al` only; proper-name articles always Branch B (LA translations omit them);
  vos/tú regional note; ustedes for 2nd plural; no personal infinitive.
- `nt/fra.py` — French. NOT pro-drop (subject pronouns required; secondary when no Greek
  pronoun — inverse of Spanish/Portuguese). Contracted forms du/des/au/aux (non-contracting
  stay two words). Double-article attributive handled (first → Branch A, second → Branch B).
  Partitive du/de la/des secondary for anarthrous mass nouns. Reflexive passive (se + verb)
  and impersonal "on" as passive equivalent. Discontinuous ne…X negation; "point" is a dated
  LSG (1910) alternative to "pas" (460 NT instances in LSG vs. ~1 in the modern AFBRT sample)
  — align like "pas" but don't expect it from modern translations. μόνον/μόνος DEFAULTS to
  "seul(ement)" (75-84% of 111 checked instances across LSG/TOB10/ULBFR) — restrictive
  "ne…que" is a real but minority variant (3-5%), not the standard rendering as originally
  drafted. "aucun(e)" is a stable alternative to personne/rien/nul. Distilled from
  `docs/alignment-principles-nt.fra.md` (and `alignment-principles-ot.fra.md` for
  `ot/fra.py`), reverse-engineered from the pre-existing code and then corpus-checked
  against LSG/AFBRT/TOB10/ULBFR — see that document's "Cross-translation methodology note".
- `nt/ind.py` — Indonesian. No articles (Branch B is the default, not the exception,
  confirmed at full-corpus scale: itu/ini appear on ≤22% of article tokens); "itu"/"ini"
  only for anaphoric/demonstrative mentions. Fused possessive/object clitics (-ku/-mu/
  -nya) for singular pronouns only. "yang" is the universal relativizer for substantive
  participles, but generic/gnomic reference ("whoever does X") often uses "barangsiapa"/
  "siapa" instead — a third strategy confirmed against a second Indonesian NT (KKHv0),
  which uses different lexemes for the same slot. Two passive strategies: di- prefix
  (direct, one fused word, no auxiliary) vs. ter- + "ada" (resultative, for γέγραπται-type
  perfects, confirmed 14/15 sampled instances). Ordinary negation is contiguous
  (tidak/jangan + verb), but οὐκέτι/μηκέτι ("no longer") is discontinuous — the verb
  regularly separates "tidak"/"bukan" from "lagi"; "bukan" (not "tidak") negates
  nominal/copular predicates. No infinitive form; articular/temporal infinitive renders as
  a finite clause with "ketika"/"saat". Distilled from `docs/alignment-principles-nt.ind.md`,
  which was cross-checked against KKHv0 (a second complete Indonesian NT; ID_GLT excluded —
  it covers only a subset of epistles, not a complete NT) — see that document's
  "Cross-translation methodology note".
- `nt/hin.py` — Hindi. No articles; split-ergative ने and DOM/dative को have partial or no
  Greek trigger; genitive का/की/के agrees with the possessed noun, not the possessor. Finite
  verbs are almost always periphrastic (participle + copula) by default, not stylistic
  choice. Light verbs (noun + करना/होना) vs. vector verbs (V1 + bleached V2) are easily
  confused — N:1 both primary vs. V1 primary/V2 secondary respectively. At least six
  coexisting passive-voice strategies (true periphrastic passive with जाना is the actual
  default). Substantive participles: जो is the majority default regardless of genericity;
  वाला is reserved for lexicalized role-labels, not generic vs. specific referents. कि/ताकि/
  जिससे are free variants for ἵνα, not distinct constructions. नहीं/न are free variants for
  ordinary negation; न is also the dedicated correlative form for "neither...nor" (aligns
  1:1 to each οὐδέ/οὔτε); मत is the true prohibitive; emphatic negation (οὐ μή) has no single
  construction, just an optional reinforcing intensifier. Distilled from
  `docs/alignment-principles-nt.hin.md`, which was cross-checked against two further Hindi
  NT translations (HSB, OHCV) to separate general Hindi grammar from one translation's
  stylistic choices — see that document's "Cross-translation methodology note".
- `nt/arb.py` — Arabic (Van Dyck). **Reviewed by a native Arabic speaker and confirmed
  "very good."** Target TSV tokenizes on
  whitespace only, and Arabic orthography fuses conjunctions (وَ/فَ), prepositions
  (بِ/لِ/كَ), the definite article (ال), and pronominal suffixes onto the adjacent
  word with no space — one target token routinely corresponds to 2-4 Greek tokens,
  making N:1 records the dominant pattern rather than an occasional case. Construct-
  state (ʾiḍāfa) genitive chains carry no token at all for "of" (unlike English's
  secondary "of"). The fused article is treated as primary (not secondary, unlike
  every other supported language) since it is a real definite-article morpheme —
  flagged as an open question for native-speaker review. Passive voice has six
  coexisting strategies, with true morphological passive the most common (a reversal
  of an early single-verse-based hypothesis); the derived-stem active-verb strategy is
  real but narrower, limited to physical/experiential change-of-state verbs. Negation
  particle choice is aspect-conditioned (لم covers aorist AND perfect); emphatic
  negation (οὐ μή) has no dedicated construction. Substantive participles split three
  ways by referent type (ism al-fāʿil / الَّذِي / مَنْ, closer to Indonesian's
  yang/barangsiapa split than Hindi's single-default जो). Classical Arabic has no true
  infinitive — the Greek infinitive's role splits across five distinct strategies
  (أَنْ+subjunctive, a purpose-marker family, nominalization, or a finite clause)
  depending on syntactic function; ἵνα-as-infinitive-substitute collapses into the
  same أَنْ pattern. Verbal aspect (iterative/conative/ingressive) is marked
  explicitly *less* often than Greek/English — a plain unmarked verb is the majority
  outcome. Distilled from `docs/alignment-principles-nt.arb.md`, cross-checked against
  ONAV (a second, more dynamic Arabic NT translation) verse-by-verse — see that
  document's "Cross-translation methodology note" and its per-section "Open questions"
  for what remains unconfirmed; the sample size (~20-30 verses per construction) is
  well short of Hindi's corpus-wide validation.
- `nt/zht.py` — Traditional Chinese (Mandarin). **Rebuilt 2026-08-20 from raw text +
  reasoning, no alignment data anywhere — see `project_zht_alignment_paused` in the
  auto-memory system for the full history.** An earlier draft used Clear-Bible's
  `alignments-cmn` repo (Biblica's CUVMPS gold alignment, cross-checked against UBS's
  CU2010T alignment) and was retracted by direction: CUVMPS was found to diverge from
  our own CUV in more than script (a real `神`/`上帝` lexical difference, the
  神版/上帝版 dual-edition tradition, plus an unexplained 85.4% verse-level token-count
  mismatch), and CU2010T's alignment was confirmed unreliable for word-level
  verification (98.8% of negation particles showed "unaligned" despite the Chinese
  text plainly containing a negator every time it was spot-checked — that alignment was
  built for a different purpose). The rebuild instead spot-checks 12–25 randomly
  sampled verses per construction against two independent raw texts: our own CUV and
  **BOCCB2023T** (Biblica® Open Chinese Contemporary Bible 2023, Traditional — a
  genuinely independent modern translation, confirmed by comparing Genesis 1:1 wording
  directly), plus unconditioned whole-corpus character counts and general linguistic
  reasoning — no third party's alignment judged as ground truth. Findings hold up
  directionally versus the retracted draft but without exact percentages: no articles
  by default (spot-checked, not corpus-counted); `的` overloaded across genitive
  marker, attributive linker, and substantive-participle nominalizer, plus a related
  literary nominalizer `所` (often `為...所`/`所...的`) that the earlier
  character-matching pass missed entirely; the disposal construction (`將`/`把`) is
  real but `將` is confirmed polysemous (also "about to" and the fixed noun `將來`,
  neither of which is the disposal construction — 2 of 15 raw hits in one sample were
  false positives); copula εἰμί splits four ways, with `就是` confirmed to appear
  independently in BOTH CUV and BOCCB2023T at different verses, directly refuting the
  earlier retracted "CUV-specific" claim; passive voice's unmarked-verb-majority
  finding held up in a 25-verse spot-check (`被` didn't appear at all in that CUV
  sample), and surfaced a literary `為...所`/`所...的` passive marker and a
  reflexive/self-directed active-conversion strategy neither of which the earlier
  character-matching pass could have found; reflexive `自己` confirmed genuinely
  narrow (1 of 15 sampled αὐτός instances triggered the coreference-substitution
  reading); aspect particle `過` confirmed NOT obligatory even on negated perfects (a
  real counter-example found), and stative "know" verbs consistently take no aspect
  particle at all. CUV consistently uses the variant characters `着`/`裏` (not
  `著`/`裡`, which BOCCB2023T uses) — all worked examples use CUV's actual characters.
  `IMPERSONAL`, `INFINITIVE`, `HINA`, `COMPARATIVE`, `HOTI`, `CONDITIONAL`, and
  `NEGATION` blocks are imported unchanged from `eng.py` — out of scope for this
  research pass, unlike Hindi's negation/infinitive coverage; confirm with a native
  speaker before assuming they transfer cleanly, especially negation. **Draft — not yet
  reviewed by a native Mandarin speaker.** Simplified Chinese (zhs) is a fully separate
  config (not derived from this one) and will get its own doc/code once real Simplified
  target data is available — see `docs/alignment-principles-nt.zht.md`.
- `ot/eng.py` — OT English config.
- `ot/arb.py` — OT Arabic (Van Dyck). **Reviewed by a native Arabic speaker and
  confirmed "very good,"** matching the review `nt/arb.py` received earlier this week.
  Follows `nt/arb.py`'s mechanics:
  whitespace-only AVD target tokenization plus fused conjunctions/prepositions/article/
  suffixes means N:1 records dominate, same as NT. Built in two passes: Pass 1 was a
  ~15-verse spot-check; Pass 2 re-verified every item flagged as an open question after
  Pass 1 against full-corpus or large stratified samples (WLCM joined to AVD/ONAV by
  verse), and several Pass-1 single-instance claims did not survive — see each finding
  below and `docs/alignment-principles-ot.arb.md`'s "Cross-translation methodology
  note" for the full breakdown of what changed between passes.
  Construct-state (ʾiḍāfa) genitive chains are a genuine typological match to Hebrew's
  own construct chains (both mark possession by bare noun-noun juxtaposition,
  head-first) — no supplied "of"-equivalent is needed, closer to Indonesian's OT
  finding than to NT Arabic's (which supplies iḍāfa for a Greek case-marked genitive
  Arabic itself doesn't morphologically mark). Verified at scale (28-verse exhaustive
  sample of construct-participles after הָיָה/וַיְהִי): bare ʾiḍāfa is the actual
  majority even for occupational-title participles (armor-bearer, ark-bearers, archer
  all stayed bare) — the one confirmed exception is a lexicalized `אֲבִי` ("father of")
  + participle idiom, not a general occupational-participle rule.
  Pronominal suffixes split by grammatical ROLE, not host type (a finding not present
  in any other OT config): object/possessive suffixes are always primary regardless of
  whether the host is a noun, preposition, finite verb, participle, or an infinitive
  construct's own object; only a suffix marking the SUBJECT of an infinitive construct
  restructured as a finite clause is secondary, since Arabic verb agreement already
  carries that information.
  Negation: לֹא and אַל both converge on `لَا`; nominal/copular negation uses `لَيْسَ`.
  Existential אֵין/אַיִן — verified at scale (24-verse sample of 659 corpus instances):
  three coexisting strategies, not the single `لَمْ يَكُنْ` Pass 1 assumed — `لا
  النافية للجنس` (bare `لَا` + accusative predicate) is most common overall, `لَيْسَ`
  (often + `مَنْ`) a close second, `لَمْ يَكُنْ` real but narrower (concrete-noun
  narrative prose). `לֹא...עוֹד` ("no longer") discontinuity confirmed decisively at
  scale, matching NT Arabic's οὐκέτι/μηκέτι finding.
  Passive voice (30-verse sample across niphal/pual/hophal, ~5,024 corpus instances,
  not present in Pass 1 at all): true morphological passive dominates even more than NT
  Arabic's own revised finding (~77% of clean instances); a derived-stem active-form
  verb (Form V/VII/VIII) is real but narrow, clustering around reciprocal/collective/
  self-affecting actions; a genuine fourth strategy — plain adjectival/stative
  rendering — appears for niphal forms marking a state rather than an event.
  Substantive participles split three ways (ism al-fāʿil / `الَّذِي` / `كُلُّ مَنْ`),
  matching NT Arabic's structure; `كُلُّ مَنْ`/`كُلُّ مَا` is confirmed (96-instance
  full-corpus search) as the dominant strategy specifically for Hebrew's casuistic
  legal formula `כָּל הַ`+participle, resolving the open question Indonesian OT flagged
  as unproductive. Predicative participles (main-clause predicate) — reversed after a
  9-verse sample: finite-verb conversion is the majority, not bare-participle
  predication as a single incidental example first suggested; bare participles remain
  real but minority, clustering around postural/stative verbs.
  Purposive/complement `לְ`+infinitive (verified against 4,573 corpus instances, the
  largest infinitive category) splits three ways: purposive `لِ`/`لِكَيْ` (majority),
  `أَنْ`+subjunctive complement clause (matches NT Arabic), nominalization
  (masdar+preposition). Infinitive absolute — reversed after a 20-verse sample: cognate
  accusative and complete non-marking are roughly equally common, including within AVD
  itself, not the clean AVD-cognate-vs-ONAV-adverb split Pass 1's single verse
  suggested — though the cognate-accusative strategy, when it does occur, remains a
  genuinely closer structural parallel than any other supported language has.
  Dual number (7-verse sample of 1,933 corpus instances): dual-to-dual is the majority
  pattern but not automatic — real lexeme-specific exceptions collapse to Arabic
  singular ("nostrils" → "nose") or plural ("doors", "eyelids").
  Distilled from `docs/alignment-principles-ot.arb.md`, cross-checked against ONAV's OT
  (`ot_ONAV.tsv`) verse-by-verse, following `nt/arb.py`'s cross-translation
  methodology; see that document's "Cross-translation methodology note" and "Open
  questions" sections for what remains unconfirmed (mostly finer-grained sub-questions
  the Pass-2 findings themselves raised, not gaps in section coverage — every item on
  the original Pass-1 open-questions list has now been addressed).
- `ot/zht.py` — OT Traditional Chinese (Mandarin). **Rebuilt 2026-08-20 from raw text +
  reasoning, no alignment data anywhere — see `project_zht_alignment_paused` in the
  auto-memory system for the full history.** An earlier draft rested entirely on
  `WLCM-CU2010T-manual.json` (the OT's only ever-produced alignment — no CUVMPS OT
  alignment exists to fall back on) and was retracted by direction: that alignment was
  confirmed unreliable for word-level verification (98.8% of לֹא tokens showed
  "unaligned" despite the Hebrew text plainly having a Chinese negation correspondent in
  every sampled verse). The rebuild mirrors `nt/zht.py`'s: WLCM.tsv joined by verse to
  CUV's and BOCCB2023T's raw target text, 14-20 verses sampled and hand-classified per
  construction, no alignment touched. **Two genuine reversals surfaced by reading real
  text instead of trusting character-matching over the retracted alignment**:
  participial constructions (previously claimed near-zero `的` for substantive/
  attributive participles — false; they regularly take `的`, either bare-nominalized
  `凡跌倒的` or with a head noun `南邊安的營`, once the real split — verbal/predicative
  vs. substantive/attributive function, not mere article-adjacency — is checked) and
  pronominal suffixes (previously claimed explicit pronoun marking was the exception —
  also false, an artifact of a crude character set missing forms like `它`/`她`;
  careful reading shows explicit marking is the majority outcome, dropped only when the
  referent is already established or the phrase is idiomatic). No articles by default,
  confirmed in a spot-check, with a precise recurring trigger for the demonstrative
  branch: the fixed `יוֹם/עֵת הַהוּא` ("that day/time") idiom, not general anaphora.
  Construct chains: `的` presence correlates with possessor type — pronominal-suffix
  possessors usually get `的` (`他的僕人`), full-noun possessors (especially names/
  geography) usually don't (`亞割谷`). Passive voice: unmarked/restructured-active is
  still the majority, but `被` is real and clustered specifically around violent/
  adversative events (capture, destruction, exile) in every sampled instance — a
  cleaner confirmation of the adversative-connotation theory than the NT sample gave
  (which had zero `被`). A `所`-nominalizer strategy appears here too, matching the NT
  doc's finding. Infinitival constructions were not independently re-verified at the
  same depth as the rest of this rebuild — flagged honestly as inherited by analogy.
  **Draft — not yet reviewed by a native Mandarin speaker.**
  Distilled from `docs/alignment-principles-ot.zht.md`.
- `__init__.py` — re-exports the public API and imports all language modules to trigger
  registration.

**To add a new target language:** create `prompt/<iso>.py`, define a `LanguagePromptConfig`
with the appropriate block content, and call `register_language()`. Then add the import
to `__init__.py`. Import unchanged blocks from `eng.py` rather than duplicating them.
Unknown language codes fall back to English automatically.

**Prompt style:** all prompt blocks are compressed (rules + examples; no motivating prose
or meta-commentary). Prose reference copies are preserved as `*.prose.py` siblings (not
imported, `register_*_language` call commented out) for each language file that has been
compressed. Approximate token budget (all blocks assembled):

| Config | ~tokens |
|--------|---------|
| NT eng | 3,274 |
| NT por | 3,614 |
| NT spa | 3,599 |
| NT fra | 4,488 |
| NT ind | ~5,234 |
| NT hin | ~7,055 |
| NT arb | ~15,958 |
| NT zht | ~6,842 |
| OT eng | ~3,031 |
| OT por | ~3,789 |
| OT spa | ~4,020 |
| OT fra | ~5,072 |
| OT ind | ~5,254 |
| OT arb | ~7,187 |
| OT zht | ~4,550 |

NT ind/hin/arb and all OT figures use `tiktoken` (cl100k_base) on the fully-assembled
prompt (all conditional blocks included), matching `cost_estimate.py`'s counting method
— only the NT eng/por/spa/fra figures predate that measurement approach and have not
been recomputed; the rest are freshly recomputed against the current file contents, not
carried forward from whenever each config was first measured. NT arb is still far
larger than the rest because every one of its 11
conditional blocks is Arabic-specific (none still import `eng.py` unchanged, unlike
every other language) — expect the highest per-verse prompt cost of any
currently-supported NT config. OT arb grew well past OT ind's size across two rounds of
corpus-scale verification despite the OT block set being much smaller than NT's (4
conditional blocks vs. 11) — still the largest OT config.

Both NT arb and OT arb were compressed once already (down from ~18,128 and ~8,035
respectively) by deleting sample-size citations, cross-language comparisons, and other
meta-commentary that doesn't change alignment behavior, while preserving every rule and
worked example — a pure token-budget pass, not a content or accuracy change. Further
compression is possible (both remain the largest configs in their testament) but was
intentionally left as headroom for a future pass rather than pushed further in one
sitting, to keep the diff reviewable and the typo risk from hand-editing dense
Hebrew/Arabic text low.

Current languages: eng, por, spa, fra, ind, hin, arb, zht (both NT arb and OT arb have
been reviewed by a native Arabic speaker and confirmed "very good"; both NT and OT zht
have been rebuilt from raw text + reasoning — see
`project_zht_alignment_paused` in the auto-memory system for the full history — with no
alignment data used anywhere in either. Neither NT nor OT zht has had native-speaker
review; see `docs/alignment-principles-nt.arb.md`, `docs/alignment-principles-ot.arb.md`,
`docs/alignment-principles-nt.zht.md`, and `docs/alignment-principles-ot.zht.md`).
Planned: Chinese Simplified, Gujarati, Nepali, Tok Pisin, Bislama, Lingala, Swahili.

## LLM providers (`refine/llm.py`)

`LLMClient` supports seven providers, selected by the `provider` argument:

| Provider | Env var | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Uses Responses API for reasoning models |
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Extended thinking via `thinking` block |
| `google` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini 3+ `thinkingLevel` via `ThinkingConfig` |
| `openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenAI-compatible proxy to 200+ models (Qwen, Kimi, GLM, …); sync-only; per-call cost tracked in `LLMClient.session_cost` |
| `gloo` | `GLOO_CLIENT_ID`, `GLOO_CLIENT_SECRET` | Gloo AI Studio; OAuth2 bearer token (1-hr TTL, auto-refreshed); SSE streaming via `requests`; routes to Anthropic/OpenAI/Google; sync-only; no reasoning_effort; model IDs like `gloo-anthropic-claude-sonnet-4.5` |
| `deepinfra` | `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY` | OpenAI-compatible proxy to DeepInfra-hosted open models, `base_url="https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai"`; sync-only; no reasoning_effort; no async batch; no per-call cost tracking (unlike `openrouter`, DeepInfra's response `usage` doesn't carry a `cost` field) |
| `ollama` | `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (optional) | Local inference via Ollama's OpenAI-compatible API; default base URL `http://localhost:11434/v1`; sync-only; no reasoning_effort; no async batch |

`reasoning_effort` (none/minimal/low/medium/high) maps to `reasoning_effort` for OpenAI
and `thinkingLevel` for Google. Omitting it sends no thinking config. Ignored for
`openrouter`, `gloo`, `deepinfra`, and `ollama` (always use the chat completions path).

`OLLAMA_BASE_URL` can be set in `.env` to point at any OpenAI-compatible local endpoint
(e.g. `http://localhost:8080/v1` for `mlx_lm.server`) without code changes.

## OpenRouter cost tracking (`refine/llm.py`)

`LLMClient.session_cost` accumulates the USD cost of all OpenRouter calls made during
the session. `_track_openrouter_cost(response)` reads `response.usage.model_extra["cost"]`
(Pydantic captures extra fields OpenRouter adds to the standard usage object) and prints
a per-call + running total after each API call. A session total is printed at the end of
`refine-alignment` and `retry-alignment` when `--llm-provider openrouter` is active.
Async batch mode is not supported for `openrouter` or `gloo`.

## OpenRouter DeepSeek provider ordering (`refine/llm.py`)

When the provider is `openrouter` and the model slug contains `deepseek` (case-insensitive),
`_call_openai` automatically adds `extra_body={"provider": {"order": ["DeepSeek", "deepseek"],
"allow_fallbacks": False}}` to the API call. This pins routing to DeepSeek's own
infrastructure (cheapest option) and disables silent fallback to other providers.
Any `:nitro` or `:exacto` variant suffix is stripped from the model name in the same
call, as those suffixes conflict with explicit provider ordering.

## Gloo AI provider (`refine/llm.py`)

`_GlooAuth` handles OAuth2 client-credentials auth for Gloo AI Studio.  Tokens have a
1-hour TTL; `_GlooAuth._token()` auto-refreshes 60 s before expiry so long-running jobs
never hit an expired-token error.  Credentials are read from `GLOO_CLIENT_ID` /
`GLOO_CLIENT_SECRET`.

`_call_gloo` uses the OpenAI-compatible chat completions format with SSE streaming
(`"stream": True`).  `_GlooAuth.post(payload, stream=True)` returns a raw
`requests.Response`; `_accumulate_gloo_stream(response)` consumes the SSE events and
concatenates `choices[0].delta.tool_calls[0].function.arguments` fragments into a
complete JSON string, then returns a dict matching the non-streaming response shape.
The entire accumulate call is wrapped in `_api_call_with_backoff` so
`ChunkedEncodingError` (server drops stream mid-generation), `ConnectionError`, and
`Timeout` (stream stalls — no bytes for 90 s) are retried with exponential backoff.
`reasoning_effort` is ignored (Gloo routes to the underlying provider; no pass-through
for thinking config).  Async batch mode is not supported for Gloo.

Streaming is used because Gloo routes through Cloudflare, which enforces a ~100 s
timeout on the first response byte.  Non-streaming calls to slow models time out with
a 504 before generation begins; streaming bypasses this by delivering the first SSE
chunk as soon as the model starts.  `timeout=(30, 90)` on the `requests` call sets a
30 s connect timeout and a 90 s *read* timeout (reset on every chunk received, so it
caps only silent stalls, not total stream duration).  An earlier version used a `None`
read timeout ("so long generations are not killed") but this let a silent Cloudflare
stall — bytes stop arriving without the connection closing — hang `iter_lines()`
forever with no exception ever raised, bypassing all retry/backoff logic entirely.
This caused both a GHA job to sit for hours until the runner's own timeout killed it,
and local runs to hang indefinitely on affected batches. `_accumulate_gloo_stream`
catches `Timeout` alongside `ChunkedEncodingError`, prints the same DEBUG diagnostic
line, and re-raises so `_api_call_with_backoff` retries it normally.

Gloo model IDs follow the pattern `gloo-{family}-{model}`, e.g.:
- `gloo-anthropic-claude-sonnet-4.5`
- `gloo-openai-gpt-4.1-mini`
- `gloo-google-gemini-2.5-flash`

`_status_code()` handles `requests.HTTPError` via the string-prefix fallback
(`"429 Client Error: …"` → 429), so `_api_call_with_backoff` retries correctly.

`_GlooAuth.post` catches `HTTPError` from `raise_for_status()` and re-raises it with
the full response body appended (`— {detail}`) so error messages include the server's
explanation rather than just the HTTP status line.

## Environment variable loading (`refine/llm.py`)

`load_dotenv()` is called at module import time, so a `.env` file in the project root
is loaded automatically before any provider client is initialised. All provider env vars
(`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
`GLOO_CLIENT_ID`, `GLOO_CLIENT_SECRET`) can be set there. `.env.example` in the repo
root documents all supported variables. `.env` is gitignored.

## Model names

Never substitute a user-specified model name for a known one, even if the name looks
unfamiliar (e.g. `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`). Trust the user.

## render-alignment (`render/html.py`)

- Multi-primary and idiom non-anchor cells render a directional triangle + subscript
  source index. The triangle (`▸` / `◂`) points toward the anchor cell.
- `_tri_toward(token_pos, anchor_pos, is_r2l)` computes the correct direction.
- CSS classes: `.tri` (triangle, 90% font-size), `.sub` (subscript, 60%).
- `is_r2l` (RTL layout, `dir='rtl'` on the chapter/verse containers) is
  **auto-detected** from `--alignment-lang` via `text_align.languages.RTL_LANGUAGES`
  (currently `arb`, `apd`, `fas`, `heb`, `arc` — mirrors the `is_rtl=True` entries in
  BN-Content's `aquifer_pipeline.languages` registry, copied locally rather than taken
  as a cross-repo dependency; shared with `compare-alignment`, see below).
  `--r2l`/`--no-r2l` (an `argparse.BooleanOptionalAction`, default `None`) overrides
  the auto-detection when passed explicitly; a YAML config's `r2l:` key works the same
  way via `set_defaults`. This applies to the *target* translation's directionality —
  mixed-directionality verses (e.g. AVD Arabic target + SBLGNT Greek source, or WLCM
  Hebrew source + a LTR target) are already handled correctly by the existing
  `is_r2l`-parameterized rendering logic regardless of which side is RTL.

## RTL language registry (`text_align/languages.py`)

`RTL_LANGUAGES` (frozenset of ISO 639-3 codes) and `is_rtl_language(code)` are the
single source of truth for right-to-left detection, shared by `render-alignment`
(`render/html.py`) and `compare-alignment` (`compare_html.py`/`compare_cli.py`).
Mirrors BN-Content's `aquifer_pipeline.languages` `is_rtl=True` entries — update both
registries together if a new RTL language is added.

`compare-alignment`'s HTML diff (`compare_html.render_verse_table`) takes two
*independent* RTL flags, since source and target directionality don't correlate:
`source_r2l` marks the "src text" `<td>` `dir="rtl"` (true whenever `--corpus ot`,
since WLCM Hebrew is always RTL — not language-detected, since the OT source is always
Hebrew); `target_r2l` marks the "ours"/"Biblica" `<td>`s `dir="rtl"`, auto-detected
from `--target-language` via `RTL_LANGUAGES` the same way `render-alignment` does, with
the same `--r2l`/`--no-r2l` override convention. `gloss` (always English) and `src id`
are never marked RTL.

## LLM robustness (`refine/llm.py`)

`_TOOL_CHOICE_INCOMPATIBLE` is a module-level `frozenset` of model names known to
reject `tool_choice`.  `_call_openai` and `_call_gloo` initialize
`_tool_choice_dropped = self.model in _TOOL_CHOICE_INCOMPATIBLE` so these models omit
`tool_choice` from the first call rather than trying-then-dropping on error.  Current
members: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` (openrouter), `gloo-deepseek-v4-pro` (gloo).
The runtime catch-and-retry in `_call_openai` remains active for unknown models.

`_iter_verse_entries(data, errors)` is a helper used by all five provider call paths
(`_call_openai`, `_call_openai_responses`, `_call_anthropic`, `_call_gemini`, `_call_gloo`). It
iterates the `verses` array from a tool-call response, skipping and logging any entry
that is not a dict. This guards against malformed model output (e.g. a string element
in the array) that would otherwise crash with `AttributeError` on `.get()`.

`_api_call_with_backoff(fn, max_retries, provider)` wraps each provider's API call.
It retries on 408 (provider timeout), 429 (rate-limited), 500/502/503 (provider error),
504 (gateway timeout), 520/522/524 (Cloudflare transient) with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, …) up to
`max_retries` times, and on `requests.exceptions.Timeout`. Fails fast on non-retriable errors. `_status_code(exc)`
extracts the HTTP status code from any provider exception.
Exposed via `--max-api-retries` (default 4) in `refine-alignment`.

## render-alignment header (`render/html.py`)

Each chapter file opens with a styled `.file-meta` row below the `<h1>` showing:
edition abbreviation + full name, LLM provider/model/reasoning_effort (read from
`group_meta["llm"]` in the alignment JSON), and the render date.

- `_build_meta_row(meta_info)` assembles the HTML row; missing fields are omitted
  gracefully.
- `AlignmentsReader.group_meta` (added to `burrito/alignments.py`) exposes the full
  group-level JSON meta dict so render can read back whatever refine stored.
- `--target-edition-name` CLI arg (also `target_edition_name` in YAML) supplies the
  full translation name; the edition abbreviation comes from `--alignment-edition`.

## refine-alignment output granularity

Output is one JSON file per chapter, not one per corpus:

```
SBLGNT-OENGB-41-003-manual.json   ← Mark 3 (book 41, chapter 003)
SBLGNT-OENGB-41-004-manual.json
```

Format: `{corpus_id}-{edition}-{BB}-{CCC}-manual.json`.
The internal SB 0.4 JSON structure is identical to the old corpus-level file;
it just covers one chapter.

## refine-alignment range filtering

New args narrow which verses are processed. All are mutually exclusive with
each other and with `--verse` / `--verse-range`.

| Arg | Format | Example |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `--book BB` | 2-digit book number | `--book 41` |
| `--book-range BB BB` | inclusive book range | `--book-range 41 44` |
| `--chapter BBCCC` | 5-digit chapter | `--chapter 41003` |
| `--chapter-range BBCCC BBCCC` | inclusive chapter range | `--chapter-range 41001 41016` |

Filtering uses string-prefix comparison on 8-char `BBCCCVVV` verse IDs
(`vid[:2]` = book, `vid[:5]` = chapter); no extra biblelib imports needed.

## Async batch mode (`refine/async_batch.py`)

`refine-alignment --batch-mode async` submits all LLM calls to the provider's
batch API (all three providers implemented) and exits, writing a job metadata
JSON to `jobs/{provider}/{stem}.json`.

`fetch-batch <job-metadata-file>` retrieves completed results and writes
chapter JSON files. Flags: `--poll` (print status, exit), `--wait` (block
until done), `--cancel` (request cancellation).

## fetch-batch progress display (`fetch_batch.py`)

`--poll` and `--wait` show request-level progress counts for OpenAI and
Anthropic (Google exposes only a coarse state enum, so it stays state-only).

- `_openai_progress(batch)` — derives `done/total` from `request_counts.completed`
  + `request_counts.failed`; appends `, N failed` when non-zero.
- `_anthropic_progress(batch)` — sums `succeeded + errored + expired + canceled`
  for `done`; total includes `processing`; appends `, N errored` when non-zero.

Both helpers fall back to the bare status string if `request_counts` is absent
or all zeros (guards against API objects that omit the field).

Example output during `--wait`:
```
  Batch batch_abc123: in_progress  47/200 — waiting ...
  Batch batch_abc123: in_progress  118/200
  Batch batch_abc123: completed
```

Job metadata format: see `docs/batch-api-plan.md`.

Google batch API: `client.batches.create(src=types.BatchJobSource(inlined_requests=[...]))`.
Each `InlinedRequest` carries `metadata={"request_index": "N"}` for result
matching; responses come back as `job.dest.inlined_responses`.

OpenAI batch API: JSONL file uploaded via `files.create`, then submitted with
`batches.create(input_file_id=..., endpoint=..., completion_window="24h")`.
Uses `/v1/responses` when `reasoning_effort` is set, `/v1/chat/completions`
otherwise.

Anthropic batch API: `client.messages.batches.create(requests=[...])` where
each request carries a `custom_id` (the request index as a string) and `params`
matching the `messages.create` schema. Terminal state: `processing_status ==
"ended"`. Individual result types: `"succeeded"`, `"errored"`, `"expired"`,
`"canceled"`. Results retrieved via `client.messages.batches.results(batch_id)`.

## Sync/async generation parameter parity (`refine/llm.py`, `async_batch.py`)

Batch API infrastructure may apply different defaults than the sync path
(different temperature, lower token limits), causing consistent quality
degradation on the async path. Fix: `LLMClient` now always sends `temperature`
and `max_output_tokens` explicitly on every call — both sync and async.

Defaults: `temperature=1`, `max_output_tokens=4000`. Temperature is not sent for
OpenAI reasoning models (it is fixed by the API). Overridable via `--temperature` and
`--max-output-tokens` CLI flags (also settable in YAML config files).

**`max_output_tokens` guidance by corpus and provider:**

| Scenario | Recommended `max_output_tokens` |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| NT, any provider | 4 000 (default) |
| OT, Gloo/DeepSeek (thinking disabled) | 8 000 — OT verses are larger; 4 000 risks `finish_reason=length` truncation on complex verses |
| OT or NT, Anthropic thinking retry | 32 000 — thinking tokens come *out of* `max_tokens`; too low truncates thinking + output together |
| OT or NT, OpenAI o-series reasoning | 32 000 — `max_completion_tokens` covers reasoning + output combined (same behaviour as Anthropic) |

The claim that "OpenAI/Google reasoning tokens are separate from the output budget" is
**incorrect for OpenAI o-series models** (`o1`, `o3`, `o4-mini`, etc.): their
`max_completion_tokens` is a combined budget, just like Anthropic `max_tokens`. Google
Gemini thinking tokens are genuinely separate. Empirically, 8 000 is insufficient for
OpenAI reasoning models on OT alignment; 32 000 resolves it.

Use `retry_max_output_tokens` (see below) to set a higher budget for the retry pass
while keeping a leaner budget for the first pass.

## Split-batch fallback (`refine/refine.py`, `refine/retry.py`)

In `_process_corpus_sync` (refine) and `retry_chapter_sync` (retry), `call_batch` is
wrapped in `try/except RuntimeError`.  When a batch exhausts all API retries
(exponential backoff × `max_api_retries`), the exception is caught, the missed verse
IDs are logged, and `results={}` is returned rather than crashing.  Multi-verse
batches then fall through to the existing "missing verses" resubmit loop, which
resubmits each verse individually (shorter output → less chance of a mid-stream drop).
If even an individual verse call raises `RuntimeError`, it is logged and skipped; the
verse gets no records and scores 100% uncovered (signal_1 = 1.0), guaranteeing it is
flagged for the retry pass.

This is the primary resilience mechanism for Gloo streaming: the Cloudflare proxy can
drop a long SSE stream mid-generation; streaming retries handle transient drops, and
the split-batch fallback ensures a persistent drop on one batch does not abort the
entire chapter.

## `retry_max_output_tokens` (`refine/retry_cli.py`)

Separate `max_output_tokens` budget for the retry pass.  Follows the same save/apply/
restore pattern as `retry_llm_provider` / `retry_llm_model` / `retry_reasoning_effort`:

- Saved as `args._refine_max_output_tokens` before retry overrides are applied.
- `retry_max_output_tokens` (YAML) or `--retry-max-output-tokens` (CLI) overrides
  `args.max_output_tokens` for the retry pass.
- If the fallback threshold triggers and `retry-alignment` reverts to the refine model,
  `args.max_output_tokens` is also restored to `args._refine_max_output_tokens`.

Typical config:
```yaml
# NT config
max_output_tokens: 4000          # sufficient for NT verses
retry_max_output_tokens: 32000   # full budget for Anthropic/OpenAI reasoning retry pass

# OT config
max_output_tokens: 8000          # OT verses are larger; 4000 risks truncation with Gloo/DeepSeek
retry_max_output_tokens: 32000   # full budget for Anthropic/OpenAI reasoning retry pass
```

## render-alignment chapter-file detection (`render/html.py`)

The renderer auto-detects chapter files. When `--alignment-dir` contains files
matching `{sourceid}-{edition}-??-???-manual.json`, it merges them via
`AlignmentsReader.from_chapter_files()` and skips the single-file load path.
Falls back to the single-file behavior when no chapter files are found.

Implementation details:
- `AlignmentsReader.from_chapter_files(paths, alignmentset)` — class method in
  `burrito/alignments.py`. Merges `groups[0].records` and `nonEquivalent` sets
  from all chapter files; takes `group_meta` from the first. Accepts an optional
  `_preloaded_data` dict via the regular constructor to bypass the file read.
- `AlignmentSet.__post_init__` — assertion `alignmentpath.exists()` now only
  fires when no `alignmentpath_override` is given. When chapter files are used,
  `alignmentpath_override` is set to the first chapter file (a real existing
  file), so the assertion still passes.
- `Manager.__init__` — accepts optional `preloaded_reader: AlignmentsReader`.
  When supplied, it skips creating its own reader and uses the provided one
  (still calls `clean_alignments` on it).

Full design: `docs/batch-api-plan.md`.

## Alignment quality scoring (`refine/scoring.py`, `refine/scoring_stopwords.py`)

`score_chapter_file(path, source_verses, lang, config, target_verses=None)` scores all
verses in a chapter JSON file and returns `list[VerseScore]`. Each `VerseScore` carries
five penalty signals (0–1 each) and a composite score; verses above `config.retry_threshold`
have `needs_retry=True`.

**Five signals:**

| # | Signal | What it catches |
|---|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Weighted source coverage | Unaligned source tokens, weighted by POS (verb/noun=1.0 … article=0.1) |
| 2 | Translation content-word coverage | Target words not in any record and not NEQ (stop-words excluded) |
| 3 | NEQ overuse | NEQ rate above a per-language baseline (default 10%) |
| 4 | Token smearing | N:M records where both sides have >1 independent primary and no `is_idiom` flag |
| 5 | Per-verse deviation | Verses anomalously worse than the chapter mean (second pass) |

Signals 1–4 are computed per verse; signal 5 requires a second pass over all verses in the
chapter. `score_chapter()` handles the two-pass logic and sets `needs_retry`.

**Signal 4 (smearing):** catches the cheap-model failure mode where tokens that should be
separate records (e.g. two nouns, or a preposition + noun) are grouped into one N:M record.
Weighted by `independent_p_src × p_tgt`; a 1.5× adjacency boost applies when source and
target token IDs are both consecutive, which is the strongest indicator of over-grouping.

*Bound-morpheme exclusion:* articles, conjunctions, particles, and Hebrew pronominal suffixes
(`_BOUND_SRC_POS`) are excluded from the independent-primary count. A `det`+noun grouping
is legitimate; a `prep`+noun grouping is not. A `prep`+`det`+noun record still fires because
`prep` and `noun` both count as independent (the `det` is dropped from the count but the two
remaining tokens keep `independent_p_src = 2`). This removes systematic false positives from
article+noun and conjunction-phrase groupings while preserving the signal for preposition+noun
over-grouping.

*Standalone retry gate:* `signal_4 > config.smear_forced_retry_threshold` (default 0.22)
forces `needs_retry=True` regardless of composite score. This catches verses where smearing
is the only quality problem (coverage is clean, no NEQ issues) — in those cases the composite
alone cannot reach the retry threshold even with a high signal_4 value.

**Per-language rule toggles (`build_scoring_config()`, `_LANGUAGE_SCORING_OVERRIDES`):**
`score_alignments.py` and `retry_cli.py` both build their `ScoringConfig` via
`build_scoring_config(args.target_language, ...)` rather than constructing `ScoringConfig`
directly, so a small static per-language override table can disable a signal whose
underlying assumption is structurally wrong for that language — not to tune sensitivity
(that's what the CLI/YAML thresholds are for), only to turn a check off entirely where it
doesn't apply. Two toggles exist:
- `disable_signal_4: bool` — excludes signal 4 from the composite (remaining weights
  renormalized via `ScoringConfig.effective_weights()` so composite still runs 0–1 and
  `retry_threshold` means the same thing regardless of which signals are active) and skips
  the standalone `signal_4 > smear_forced_retry_threshold` gate. `signal_4` is still
  computed and reported in the TSV for audit — just not acted on.
- `check_article_neq: bool` — skips the `article_neq_count > 0` forced-retry branch.
  `article_neq_count` is still computed and reported.

`arb` sets both: AVD's whitespace-only tokenization fuses conjunction/preposition/article/
suffix onto the adjacent word, making N:1 records the structural norm rather than the
occasional over-grouping signal 4 is designed to catch, and Arabic legitimately NEQs the
article before a bare transliterated proper name (Arabic never fuses al- onto one) — see
`docs/alignment-principles-nt.arb.md`. No other language has an override yet. Explicit
kwargs (`retry_threshold`, `neq_baseline`, `semantic_model`, `semantic_threshold`) always
take precedence over a language's static overrides.

**Stop-word lists (`scoring_stopwords.py`):** uses `stopwordsiso` (already a project
dependency) intersected with a small curated core per language to keep lists minimal.
Languages without coverage (Tok Pisin, Bislama, Lingala, …) return an empty frozenset —
the safe direction is to penalise gaps rather than suppress content words. `ind` and
`hin` have curated cores (Indonesian: space-delimited with genuine free-standing
function words, so this meaningfully reduces signal 2 noise; Hindi: was previously
missing a `_CORE` entry despite being mapped to `stopwordsiso`'s `hi` package, silently
returning empty — now fixed). `arb` deliberately has none: Arabic's function words
(waw/fa- conjunctions, bi-/li-/ka- prepositions, the definite article) are fused
proclitics that never appear as standalone whitespace tokens, so a word-list stoplist
has little to offer — and `stopwordsiso`'s Arabic package uses undiacritized forms
while the AVD/ONAV corpus is fully vocalized, so naive matching would silently fail
regardless. Revisit only alongside a diacritic-normalization pass if this becomes worth
doing.

**`ScoringConfig`** holds signal weights (w1–w5), NEQ baseline, adjacency multiplier,
smear forced-retry threshold, deviation k, and retry threshold. All overridable; defaults
work for NT English. Default weights: w1=0.25, w2=0.20, w3=0.15, w4=0.40, w5=0.00.

YAML config keys: `score_retry_threshold` (default 0.25), `smear_forced_retry_threshold`
(default 0.22). Weights are code defaults; adjust via `ScoringConfig` if needed.

## clean-alignments (`refine/clean.py`, `refine/clean_cli.py`)

Validates and repairs chapter JSON alignment files in place so that scoring and
`render-alignment` see the same data. `score-alignment` and `retry-alignment` call
`run_clean_pass()` automatically before scoring; `clean-alignments` can also be
run standalone.

Three-pass algorithm in `clean_chapter_file(path, source_ids, target_ids)`:

1. **Per-record validity** — drops records with empty source/target, source tokens
   absent from the corpus TSV (`MISSINGSOURCE`), or target tokens absent from the
   edition TSV (`MISSINGTARGETALL` / `MISSINGTARGETSOME`).
2. **Secondary-primary conflict repair** — if a token is secondary in one record
   but primary in another, it is removed from the secondary record's `source` and
   `meta.secondary.source`. If this empties the source array the record is dropped
   (`SECONDARYCONFLICT_DROP`); otherwise the record is kept as repaired
   (`SECONDARYCONFLICT`).
3. **Cross-record duplicate detection** — any source or target token still appearing
   in multiple records after pass 2 causes all offending records to be dropped
   (`DUPLICATESOURCE` / `DUPLICATETARGET`).

`run_clean_pass(chapter_files, source_verses, target_verses)` drives the loop and
returns `(files_changed, total_dropped, total_repaired)`.

## score-alignment (`refine/score_alignments.py`)

Standalone audit tool. Reads chapter JSON files and writes a per-verse TSV report (columns:
`verse_id`, `composite`, `signal_1`–`signal_5`, `needs_retry`, `coverage_flagged`,
`structural_errors`, `article_neq`, `semantic_low_sim`, `acai_unaligned`) to stdout or
`--output`. Does **not** call the LLM.

Uses the same dual flagging logic as `retry-alignment`: a verse is flagged when either
(a) composite score > `--score-retry-threshold`, or (b) `find_low_coverage_verses()`
finds ≥ `--min-unaligned-src` uncovered source tokens. The `needs_retry` column reflects
the combined result; `coverage_flagged` indicates which verses were flagged by (b).

```bash
score-alignment \
  --config OENGB --corpus nt \
  --alignment-dir path/to/LLM-REFINED \
  [--target-tsv-dir path/to/targets/OENGB]   # enables signal 2 and semantic check
  [--score-retry-threshold 0.25] \
  [--min-unaligned-src 2] \
  [--semantic-model sentence-transformers/LaBSE] \   # default; pass "" to disable
  [--semantic-threshold 0.35] \
  [--semantic-detail-output] \                        # write per-record similarity TSV to output/semantic_detail_YYYY-MM-DD.tsv
  [--acai-data-dir path/to/BibleAquifer/ACAI] \        # enables the ACAI-unaligned check
  [--acai-types people places groups ...] \            # default: all ACAI_TYPES
  [--include-acai-pronominals] \
  [--flagged-only] \
  [--output scores.tsv]
```

TSV includes an `article_neq` column (integer count). Any verse with `article_neq > 0`
is unconditionally flagged `needs_retry=True` regardless of the composite score —
NEQ'd articles are always a mistake (articles must be primary to "the"/pronoun/reinstated
proper noun, or secondary to their head noun/adjective/participle).

TSV also includes a `semantic_low_sim` column (integer count of records below threshold).
Any verse with `semantic_low_sim > 0` is unconditionally flagged `needs_retry=True`.
Requires `--target-tsv-dir`; silently skips if target text is unavailable.

TSV also includes an `acai_unaligned` column (integer count of ACAI-tagged source tokens
that are neither aligned nor NEQ'd). Any verse with `acai_unaligned > 0` is unconditionally
flagged `needs_retry=True` — a source word carrying an ACAI person/place/group/deity/
keyterm/fauna/flora/realia tag should always end up aligned to something in the target,
or explicitly NEQ'd. Requires `--acai-data-dir` (same loader as `render-alignment` and
`acai-align`: `load_acai_entities()` + `build_word_entity_map()` from
`align/acai_common.py`); silently skipped (column stays 0) when omitted. `retry-alignment`
accepts the same `--acai-data-dir`/`--acai-types`/`--include-acai-pronominals` flags and
applies the same forced-retry rule.

`--semantic-detail-output` (boolean flag, no value) writes a per-record TSV to
`output/semantic_detail_YYYY-MM-DD.tsv` (columns: `verse_id`, `src_ids`, `src_lemmas`,
`src_gloss`, `tgt_ids`, `tgt_text`, `similarity`, `below_threshold`). Primary use:
filter by `src_lemmas` to inspect the similarity distribution for specific lemmas and
calibrate the threshold.

Primary use: run between `refine-alignment` and `retry-alignment` to inspect quality
before committing to a retry spend, and to tune the threshold against manually reviewed
chapters.

## Semantic similarity scoring (`refine/semantic.py`)

Post-hoc check (runs automatically when `--target-tsv-dir` is provided): for each
eligible alignment record, embeds the source gloss and target word text using
`sentence-transformers/LaBSE` and computes cosine similarity. Records below
`--semantic-threshold` (default 0.35) contribute to a per-verse `semantic_low_sim_count`;
any verse with count > 0 is flagged `needs_retry=True`.

**Eligible records:** only records where at least one primary source token is a
content-bearing POS: `noun`, `verb`, `adj` (NT), `adjective` (OT). Function words
(articles, conjunctions, prepositions, pronouns) are excluded — they are too flexible
in translation to produce reliable similarity signals. Idiom records (`meta.is_idiom`)
are also excluded.

**Source-side text:** `gloss2` when non-empty (bare core meaning, no contextual syntax
markers), falling back to `gloss`. Dots in `gloss2` are replaced with spaces to handle
OT forms like `"he.created"` → `"he created"`. English glosses are used rather than
source-language lemmas because LaBSE's ancient-language embedding spaces (Koine Greek,
Biblical Hebrew) are dominated by Modern Greek / Modern Hebrew web text and are not
reliable for biblical vocabulary. POS names differ between corpora: NT uses `adj`, OT
uses `adjective`; both are included in `_CONTENT_POS`.

**Model:** any `sentence-transformers`-compatible model; default is
`sentence-transformers/LaBSE` (109 languages, ~470 MB). Model is lazy-loaded and
cached at module level — first call downloads and loads it; subsequent calls reuse it.
Swap via `--semantic-model` to any HuggingFace model if LaBSE coverage is insufficient
for a target language. Pass `--semantic-model ""` to disable the check entirely.

**Batching:** all records across the chapter are collected into a single encoder call
for efficiency. A per-chapter diagnostic line is printed to stderr:
`Semantic [BBCCC] N pairs, sim min=X mean=Y max=Z, N record(s) below T`

**Per-record detail output:** `--semantic-detail-output` (boolean flag) on `score-alignment`
writes a TSV to `output/semantic_detail_YYYY-MM-DD.tsv` with `verse_id`, `src_ids`,
`src_lemmas`, `src_gloss`, `tgt_ids`, `tgt_text`, `similarity`, `below_threshold` for
every scored record. Filter by `src_lemmas` to inspect the similarity distribution for
any specific lemma.

**Implementation:** `apply_semantic_scores(verse_scores, records_by_verse, src_by_id,
tgt_text_by_id, model_name, threshold, chapter_id, record_details)` in `semantic.py`.
`score_chapter_file` in `scoring.py` threads `record_details` through. Both
`score-alignment` and `retry-alignment` pass `target_verses` to `score_chapter_file`
so the semantic check has target text available.

**YAML config keys:** `semantic_model`, `semantic_threshold`.

Available on `score-alignment` and `retry-alignment`; not on `refine-alignment`.

## Two-pass workflow (cheap model → clean → score → retry)

```bash
# 1. First pass — cheap/fast model
refine-alignment --config MYEDITION --corpus nt \
  --llm-provider openrouter --llm-model deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro

# 2. Clean alignment files in place (optional standalone; also runs inside score/retry)
clean-alignments --config MYEDITION --corpus nt

# 3. Audit scores — clean pass runs automatically before scoring
score-alignment --config MYEDITION --corpus nt --flagged-only --output scores.tsv

# 4. Retry flagged verses — clean pass runs automatically before scoring
retry-alignment --config MYEDITION --corpus nt \
  --llm-provider anthropic --llm-model claude-sonnet-4-6 --reasoning-effort high
```

The YAML config supports separate model keys per pass — `retry_llm_provider`,
`retry_llm_model`, `retry_reasoning_effort` — that override the refine-phase `llm_*`
keys in `retry-alignment`. If absent, the retry pass falls back to the refine keys.

## retry-alignment (`refine/retry_cli.py`, `refine/retry.py`, `refine/scoring.py`)

Post-batch quality pass: identifies verses that scored above the retry threshold
and re-aligns them from scratch.

**Detection** (`scoring.py`, `coverage.py`): a verse is flagged when either condition
holds: (a) `score_chapter_file()` returns `composite > --score-retry-threshold`
(default 0.25), or (b) `find_low_coverage_verses()` finds at least
`--min-unaligned-src` (default 2) unaligned source tokens. Both checks run for every
chapter; a verse needs only one to trigger.

**Remedy**: flagged verses are sent to the LLM **blank-slate** — no prior
alignment is passed as a candidate. Passing existing records as candidates caused
the LLM to over-weight them and perpetuate bad alignments (including wrong
token-swap errors, not just gaps). Blank-slate lets the LLM produce a clean
realignment of the entire verse.

**Merge** (`retry.py:merge_verse_results`): replaces only the flagged verse
records in the existing chapter JSON. For non-replaced verses, regular records
are kept as-is; NEQ entries are re-inflated into `{"meta": {"rel": "NEQ"}}`
records so `build_output_alignment` can reprocess them uniformly. The resulting
file is written in place.

**Fallback threshold** (`--fallback-threshold`, default 0.25): if
`total_flagged / total_verses >= threshold` and a separate retry model is configured,
`retry-alignment` reverts to the refine-phase model instead. Rationale: a high flagged
rate indicates systemic quality issues better addressed by a cheap re-pass than targeted
expensive retries. The model actually used is always printed before the verse list.
Saved in `args._refine_llm_provider/model/reasoning_effort` before retry overrides are
applied; decision is made after scoring completes.

**Async support**: `--batch-mode async` submits retry verses to the provider
batch API (same three providers as `refine-alignment`). Job metadata carries
`"job_type": "retry"`. `fetch-batch` detects this and calls `merge_verse_results`
instead of writing fresh chapter files.

## GHA transitory data workflow (`scripts/copy-to-gha.py`, `scripts/copy-from-gha.py`)

Alignment runs on GHA need only the translation TSV for a specific config — not the full
contents of the Clear `alignments-*` repos. These two scripts implement a transitory
strategy: stage the minimum data in, run GHA, copy results back out.

**`copy-to-gha.py`** — run before triggering a GHA alignment job:
1. Copies all `*.tsv` files from `C:/git/Clear/alignments-<lang>/data/targets/<edition>/`
   into `./data/alignments/alignments-<lang>/data/targets/<edition>/`
2. If `C:/git/Clear/alignments-<lang>/exp/<edition>/<alignment_suffix>/` exists, copies
   its JSON files into the matching staging path (enables incremental GHA runs).
3. Patches `alignments_root:` in `configs/<edition>.yaml` to `./data/alignments`

After running: `git add` the TSV(s), any staged JSONs, and the patched YAML, commit,
push, then trigger the appropriate GHA workflow (`align-nt` or `align-ot`).

**`copy-from-gha.py`** — run after `git pull` brings GHA-committed results into the repo:
1. Copies `./data/alignments/alignments-<lang>/exp/<edition>/<alignment_suffix>/*.json`
   to `<clear_root>/alignments-<lang>/exp/<edition>/<alignment_suffix>/`
2. Copies `./data/alignments/alignments-<lang>/viz/<edition>/` into the Clear viz dir
   (silently skipped if not present)
3. Patches `alignments_root:` in `configs/<edition>.yaml` back to `<clear_root>`
4. Removes the edition-specific staged data from `./data/alignments/`:
   `alignments-<lang>/data/targets/<edition>/`, `exp/<edition>/`, `viz/<edition>/`

The `alignment_suffix` is read from the config YAML; defaults to `LLM-REFINED`.

Both scripts accept `--config <NAME>` (required), `--clear-root <path>` (default
`~/git/Clear-Bible`), and `--dry-run`. Neither script invokes git or GHA.

`<lang>` in every `alignments-<lang>` path above is `biblica_language` (falling back to
`target_language`) — the config key that names Biblica's actual `alignments-*` repo,
which only differs from `target_language` for Chinese today (Biblica groups zht/zhs
under the macrolanguage code `cmn`; see `biblica_language` in `config.py`'s
path-derivation docstring). Every other language's `biblica_language` coincides with
`target_language`, so this is invisible unless a config sets it explicitly.

```bash
python scripts/copy-to-gha.py  --config JFA11
# ... git add / commit / push / trigger GHA ...
# ... git pull after GHA completes ...
python scripts/copy-from-gha.py --config JFA11
```

## OT GHA workflow (`scripts/ot_chapters.py`, `.github/workflows/align-ot.yml`)

The OT has 929 chapters (books 01–39), exceeding the 256-job GHA matrix limit. It is
split into four canonical sections, each triggered as a separate `workflow_dispatch` run:

| Section | Books | Chapters |
|---------|-------|----------|
| law | Gen–Deut (01–05) | 187 |
| history | Josh–Esth (06–17) | 249 |
| poetry | Job–Song (18–22) | 243 |
| prophets | Isa–Mal (23–39) | 250 |

All four sections fit under 256 with zero chapter bundling — every chapter gets its own
job (one-to-one with NT approach).

**`scripts/ot_chapters.py`** — parallel to `nt_chapters.py`:
- `--json --section <law|history|poetry|prophets>` — emit GHA matrix JSON for that section
- `--json --chapter BBCCC` or `--book BB` — single-chapter or single-book override
- `--status --config <NAME>` — per-chapter DONE/PENDING report
- `--table` — human-readable chapter list (omit `--section` to see all 929)

**`align-ot.yml`** workflow inputs:
- `config` (required) — edition config name, e.g. `BSB`
- `section` (required) — `law` / `history` / `poetry` / `prophets`
- `chapter` / `book` — optional single-chapter or single-book override
- `model`, `batch-mode`, `max-retry-passes` — same as `align-nt.yml`

Workflows can be triggered from the CLI without going to github.com:

```bash
gh workflow run align-ot.yml \
  --field config=BSB \
  --field section=law

gh workflow run align-nt.yml \
  --field config=BSB
```

**`scripts/alignment_summary.py`** now supports `--corpus ot --section <section>` to
produce a section-scoped step summary at the end of each `align-ot` run.

## OT versification handling (`refine/refine.py`, `refine/retry.py`)

Hebrew OT and English translation Bibles often differ in verse numbering (e.g. Jonah:
Hebrew 2:1 = English 1:17). WLCM source tokens are keyed by Hebrew verse IDs; BSB
target tokens are keyed by English verse IDs. Intersecting the two sets directly
produces mismatched source/target pairings and all-NEQ output.

**Fix**: `verse_ids` is determined by iterating BSB `target_verses` keys. For each
BSB verse, the source verse is resolved via `MigrateTarget.source_verse` — a field
stored in the target TSV that carries the WLCM verse ID for each BSB token.
Multi-source-verse cases (one BSB verse spanning multiple WLCM verses) use
`MigrateVerse.source_verse_range_end`. Output chapter files are keyed by BSB
(translation) verse IDs throughout.

This pattern is applied at 7 sites: `verse_ids` determination and two src_tokens
lookups each in `_process_corpus_sync` and `_process_corpus_async` in `refine.py`,
and three lookups in `retry.py` (`retry_chapter_sync` main loop, missing-verse
resubmit, `build_retry_chapter_batches`).

Source token lookup pattern:
```python
if tgt_verse and tgt_verse.words:
    src_start = next(iter(tgt_verse.words.values())).source_verse
    src_end = tgt_verse.source_verse_range_end
    if src_end and src_end > src_start:
        src_tokens = collect_source_verse_range(source_verses, src_start, src_end)
    else:
        src_tokens = source_verses.get(src_start, [])
else:
    src_tokens = []
```

## OT source token display (`refine/prompt/common.py`)

WLCM source tokens have no `morph` field (always empty). `_format_source_token` falls
back to `pos` + `gloss` when `morph` is absent, giving the LLM part-of-speech context
and an English gloss for each Hebrew token. When proper WLCM morph data becomes
available, the `if token.morph:` branch takes priority automatically — no code change
needed.

## compare-alignment (`compare/`)

Compares our SB 0.4 alignment output against a partner org's (Biblica) hand-curated
SB 0.3 reference alignment for the same translation — reports per-verse and aggregate
precision/recall/F1 over source→target links, plus an optional HTML side-by-side diff
for human (Greek/Hebrew-literate) review.

```bash
compare-alignment --config IRVHin --corpus nt --html-output
```

`--corpus` must always be passed explicitly (it's not one of the keys `config.py`
auto-derives). Everything else (`--alignment-dir`, `--target-tsv-dir`,
`--target-language`, `--target-edition`) comes from `--config`; `--clear-root`
defaults to `~/git/Clear-Bible`. `--output` defaults to
`output/<target-edition>/compare_YYYY-MM-DD.tsv`; the TSV is always written.
`--html-output` is opt-in — omit it to skip the (more expensive) HTML diff, pass it
bare to land next to wherever `--output` ended up (same folder, same date-stamped
basename, `.html` extension — so a custom `--output` path relocates the HTML default
too), or give it an explicit path of its own.

`biblica.py` builds an `AlignmentSet`/`AlignmentsReader` pointed at Biblica's own
`~/git/Clear-Bible/alignments-{lang}/data/` tree (`{lang}` = `--biblica-language`,
falling back to `--target-language` when unset — the two differ only for Chinese, where
Biblica groups the zht/zhs scripts under the macrolanguage code `cmn`; see
`biblica_language` in `config.py`'s path-derivation docstring)
instead of writing a separate SB 0.3 parser — `AlignmentsReader._make_record` already
calls `macula_unprefixer` on every source selector (Biblica keeps the `n`/`o` canon
prefix we drop) and `read_alignments` already handles a flat, non-`groups`-wrapped
top-level JSON, which is exactly SB 0.3's shape. `load_biblica_reader(clear_root,
lang_dir, sourceid, targetid, target_language, override=None)` resolves the reference
file as `{sourceid}-{targetid}-manual.json` by default (matching the pattern documented
in Biblica's own `.toml` sidecars); override with `--biblica-reference-file` or the
corpus-specific `--biblica-reference-file-nt`/`-ot` (also settable via YAML), since the
right file is not always `-manual` and can vary by translation — Biblica's IRVHin
`alignments/` dir alone has `-manual`, `-manual0801`, `-manualCA`, `-merged`, and
unrelated unfoldingWord UGNT/UHB-based files.

Comparison scope is the **intersection** of verse ids covered by both alignment
sources — Biblica's reference is not assumed to cover a whole testament or the same
material we've aligned, and vice versa.

**Link definition** (`links.py`): a record's implied links are the full cross product
of `source_selectors × target_selectors` — both primary and secondary source ids count,
since Biblica's SB 0.3 format has no primary/secondary distinction to compare against.

**Target-id reconciliation**: our and Biblica's target TSVs are *not* assumed to share
identical tokenization (they happened to for IRVHin, but this varies by edition).
`build_target_id_map` reuses `migrate/diff.py`'s existing `build_remap` — word-level
`diff_match_patch` diffing with a fast path for identical verse text — to map Biblica
target ids into our id space per verse, tolerating minor differences (punctuation
joining/splitting, hyphen/apostrophe handling). A Biblica target id with no match
(diff assigned it to an insert/delete) is dropped from that link and counted as
unmatched, rather than excluding the whole verse. Source ids need no remap — both
sides draw from the same `SBLGNT.tsv`/`WLCM.tsv` macula tokenization by construction.

`compare_html.py` is a standalone renderer (one row per source token, color-coded by
agreement) rather than an extension of `render/html.py`'s `write_verse` — that
function's idiom/multi-primary cell-merging logic is tuned for a single alignment
source and isn't a good graft point for a second, independently-tokenized one.

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

For a quick smoke test of a specific LLM provider, use `test_gemini.py` (not committed —
local scratch file) or pass `--verse 41004003` or `--chapter 41004` to `refine-alignment`
to limit scope. `--chapter` is the natural unit for both sync and async modes.
